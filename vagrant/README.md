Using Vagrant environment
-------------------------

Now you can login by SSH to the created virtual machine:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

After that, you can use the commands of **yii-dev-tool** on the machine as usual. 
For example:

```bash
./yii-dev install di,rbac,yii-cycle,view
```


SSH keys
--------

Our vagrant environment automatically uses SSH keys from the host machine. Therefore, you do not need 
to separately generate keys for the guest machine. Just make sure the keys from your host machine are added 
to [your list of keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) on GitHub. This is necessary in order to access 
remote repositories via SSH protocol.


Bash history
------------

The bash history of the virtual machine is automatically saved to file `yii-dev-tool/vargant/history/.bash_history`
â€“ this allows you to not lose history between recreations of the machine.


PHP CLI debugging using Xdebug and PHPStorm
-------------------------------------------

Our Vagrant environment contains already configured xDebug. You need to configure only your IDE.

### In host machine:

1. Go to PHPStorm `Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Servers`
2. Add server with following parameters:
   * Name: `console` (same as `serverName=` in `yii-dev-tool/debug` script)
   * Host, port: set vagrant box IP (`192.168.135.48` by default) and port `80`
   * Debugger: Xdebug
   * [v] Use path mappings
   * Map your project root in host to relative dir in guest (for example, `/Users/Alex/Projects/yii-dev-tool` to `/yii-dev-tool`)
   * Hit OK
3. Click `PHPStorm > Run > Start listening for PHP Debug Connections`
4. **Do not forget to put a breakpoint somewhere!**

### In guest machine:

1. Go to guest machine: `vagrant ssh`
2. Run some PHP script prefixed with `yii-dev-tool/debug` script. For example:
   
   ```bash
   cd /yii-dev-tool
   ./debug ./yii-dev
   ```

3. Debugger window should open in PhpStorm
4. Enjoy! :)
